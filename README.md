This program uses the pywebio.input and pywebio.output modules to create a little grade calculator for IB Grades.
I don't know if grades work this way for other schools but in my school we get grades across 4 criteria from 0 to 8 for every subject,
in order to get that grade to a LOMCE grade which is the National system (grades out of ten) we need to do some averages and later put the grades into a table,
I decided to automate this process throught some python code, for more information run the main file (with the pywebio library installed).
